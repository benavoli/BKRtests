Bayesian Independence Test with Mixed-type Variables



This code implements a Bayesian kernelised correlation test using a Dirichlet process model to 
assess (in)dependence between mixed-type variables (text, image, sound).
It introduces a new Bayesian measure of (in)dependence which allows us to answer whether (mixed-type) variables  are independent, 
how likely dependence/independence is to hold, how high the probability is that two mixed-type 
variables are more than just weakly dependent.
